ML/Analytics: Regression, Classification, Clustering, GMMs, PCA, Time Series, EDA, Model Evaluation. \
Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn), SAS Viya, Excel. \
Ops: Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions, testing/coverage; basic Docker/Cloud familiarity.

Public Health Skills: Medicaid policy, Healthcare/Medicaid Claims Data, Clinical Coding Systems (ICD-10 CM, SNOMED, CPT, NDCs), Healthcare Systems (HCS, PSYCKES).

## **Highlights**
**Health Research Inc. (2025—)**: Automated SAS EG workflows to de‑duplicate influenza codes; improved demographic reporting accuracy by 25% via trend analyses and geolocation fixes.

**NYS Office of Mental Health (2024–2025)**: Regression models on Medicaid KPIs; automated PSYCKES ETL (SQL/SAS/Excel); 5+ Tableau dashboards for statewide response optimization; QA on HIPAA-compliant quality indicators using JIRA.

**Hypertension Risk Project (2023-2024)**: PCA for dimensionality reduction; compared SVM/RF/boosting; time‑series trend analysis across 2013/2015/2017 cohorts.

## **Projects**
**Predicting Demographic Risk Factors for Hypertension**
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space while maintaining key variance.
- Implemented Radial Basis Function kernel-based Support Vector Machines, regression techniques, tree techniques,
regularization, and boosting techniques to predict high-risk demographics.
- Performed analyses of 2013, 2015, and 2017 datasets to evaluate trends and shifts in key factors over the years by
performing time series analyses, aiding proactive public health planning.

**Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
- Incorporated machine learning to create a model that predicts passengers who survived the
Titanic shipwreck using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
- Applied algorithms to specific cases to obtain better results compared to existing ones.
  
**The New York City Taxicab Parking Lot problem**
- Implemented a modified K-Medians clustering algorithm to predict optimal parking lot locations for New York City taxicab rides, driving significant reductions in ride costs.
- Optimized the clustering process by efficiently identifying medians of clusters, resulting in a 30% increase in ride efficiency compared to the standard K-Means algorithm.

**Temperature prediction over the next 80 years using Non-Parametric Statistics** 
- Developed non-parametric statistical models to predict long-term temperature trends (80 years) for city-scale climate analysis.
- Deployed and cross-validated models on R Studio and Jupyter Notebook, systematically benchmarking platform accuracies for robust results.

## **Experience**
Health Research Inc. — Surveillance data quality, automation, and logic design; key outcome: 25% improvement in demographic accuracy, faster weekly reporting.

NYS OMH — KPI modeling, automated ETL from PSYCKES, and decision dashboards; cross‑team handoffs with JIRA‑tracked QA.
